# AssetTracking

App for keeping track of company assets using a Parent class "Asset" and two child-classes "Phone" and "Computer"
Assets are read from a json file and added to that file if user descides to add more assets.
The assets have a three year life span and if that day is closer than six months the asset is printed in yellow and if only three months remain it is printed red.
